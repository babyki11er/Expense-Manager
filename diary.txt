	+30 mins
	Organized the files with a related directory. Used DOCUMENT_ROOT from SERVER as relative links are not reliable and weird
<2023-02-14 18:05:25>
[x]:	income stuffs. rows are not being inserted.
	Analysing the code, I learned that it's easier to think the flow in terms of an execution stack.
[%]:	add archive functions
[x]:	add deleting record

<2023-02-16>
[x]:	Archiving items, categories done.
[%]:	Need implementing edit feature.
		Want to organize the api end points as well!
[x]:	allow to create a category that already exist but archived

<20>
	done editing item, still needs work for 
	[x]:	update but does not affect the past records, basically adding a new item and archiving the old one
	[x]:	update functionality on category, record.
	[*]:	organized the code more
	[%]:	click listener on item suggestions
	Will focus on income, and calculating the stuffs after all this! very excited
	[X]:	want to show income history below the form
<21>
	[x]:	update record
	[X]:	show income in records.php
	[X]:	show incomes on incomes.php and records.php
<25>
	[ Refactoring ]
	[x]:	makeResource
	[x]:	pass the resource name as the second argument, and the array as the third
	[x]:	checkResource function

[ xxx ]:	renaming a category resulting in creating a new one
	[x]:	error with get-one.api, and insert.php not selecting on choosing the item
<26>
	[X]:	convert form to grid system (UI)
[ xxx ]:	add-api.php, creating a new item instance as you insert a new record
<27>

Note:
	learn to remove duplicate static codes that i have put for some reason, replace with more compact dynamic ones.
I believe code should be designed in a way it's easier to write, instead of focusing too much on reading.
you add extra complexity in making it more maintainable, and honestly, I still have no idea on standards, therefore, it's best to write it on my own way.
Change it later, but I need something that works first.

<March>
<1>

Note:
	learn about ?? operator, yeah, I am a dumb shit. I just don't feel like home yet.
[x]:	create function with db that checks if the inserted item already existed [ db_exist()]
			(app currently insert a new item if the selected values don't match the existing ones)
[x]:	display unique item names, my approach will be item#1 item#2, etc

<2>
[ fix ]:	qty and date not setting on update record
[X]:	select statement, don't insert order by, by default
[x]:	remove unused functions
[x]:	take care of code using sql directly
Note:
	learn that foreach only have read access, copies the value instead of passing the reference
	learn about PHP doing type case fucking shit up, mistaking a string as an array, it works because the key was converted to int, which works as an index to the string, damn ..., me and PHP are like twins
<4>
[x]:	remember the order that is previously sorted, by using session variables, says we ordered the records using id, then update a record, when redirected to the records page, i want the records to be sorted by id that has been chosen previously, instead of date chosen by default
Note:
	learn that session_start stores the value on the server and send the cookies to the browser that would be like an index to look for the value, totally different from javascript sessionStorage
	associative array > switch > if/else

<5>
[R]:	html function for every echoing the variable

<15>
[x]:	remove custom sql statement

<19>
[x]:	implement view part in MVC, calling view function, no controller yet
		[x]: views pages
				read the uri and loads the script inside views folder by using view function
<20>
	[x]: write a general function for api calls, that will require each respective files
	[x]: convert each api script to functions like what a true controller does
[x]:	add validation for api controller
[x]:	fix get-one api
[x]:	fix archive api
[x]:	fix update income
Note:
	learn about MVC in somewhat more detail, controllers are just script files with defined functions for every valid cases, without main code
	You need a function or a script to decide which controller to go, then the requested function in the controller is executed, do stuffs

<21>
[x]:	refactor function calls that are returning bool instead of int
[x]:	change GET api request to POST
[x]:	convert state changing api requests to post, not REST yet
[x]:	show alerts after redirecting from api
[x]:	refactor js code

<24>
[x]:	implement controller on index
Note:	current implemention of MVC, the flow is simple:
			the request goes to the router
			router call the controller which provide all the variables to be used on view, and then call view function with the data variables
			it works right now, because controller and view having one to one relationship, might have to change later

<25>
Note:	have to say separating view and controller makes stuff easier, for example, implementing a paginator or escaping text.

<26>
Note:	i want to create each view as an object, with properties but procedural first
<27>
[x]:	edit page for outcomes
[x]:	fix add income api not redirecting to index page, but form page instead

<28>
[x]:	index, add, edit page for category

<29>
[x]:	edit record page

<30>
[x]:	finish pages for item
[x]:	record adding form should show the list page, and list page should include create new button/link
[x]:	divide view accoring to which action instead of one giant page
[x]:	implement controller for all pages

<31>
[x]:	prevent XSS by using escape function
[@]:	prevent SQL injection
[ ]:	toggle ascending and descending order, by using a second parameter, desc=1 or 0, and generate url dynamically
[ ]:	paginator
[ ]:	add summary on records.php
[ ]:	export records.json for analysis since right now app is not ready for deep stuffs which is the primary reason why I wrote this

<Refactor>
	[ ]:	put all control code in router to main-controller file
	[ ]:	design a function that will do all the requires
	[ ]:	don't use index as the path name which is pointless without extension
	[ ]:	use error_404 function instead of calling view("404") a lot
[ weird behavours ]
	+ url get requests with php extension show defalt PHP page instead

[ BUGS ]
	[ ]:	notification after updating a record saying id is #1
	[x]:	records listing page, order by note not working
