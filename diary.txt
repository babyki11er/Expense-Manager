Note:
	learn to remove duplicate static codes that i have put for some reason, replace with more compact dynamic ones.
I believe code should be designed in a way it's easier to write, instead of focusing too much on reading.
you add extra complexity in making it more maintainable, and honestly, I still have no idea on standards, therefore, it's best to write it on my own way.
Change it later, but I need something that works first.
